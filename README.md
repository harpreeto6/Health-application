## Phase 0
  
# TASK 1

- A Health app where user will be able to input whatever food they eat during the day into the app and at the end of the day they will be able to see how much calories they 
eat throughout the day. Possible features could be like adding different values of macro-nutrients along with food consumed, choose from different activities user did to get the amount of calories they burned throughout the day , or will be able to see if the user is going above their set daily calorie limit.
